Artifact of ICSE25 Submission: Expectations aren't Guarantees: Identifying the Inconsistency Between Planning and Control in Autonomous Driving

This artifact repo consists of the following three parts. For each part, please refer to the detailed README file under each folder:

 - **fuzzing** : The improved fuzzing framework, refined with the range restriction mutation, and the improved fitness score constructed from novel oracles.

 - **refined_mpc_controller** : The refined controller code, which outperforms the original controller after we fixed identified bugs.

 - **oracle_assessment** : How to assess the controller performance based on the novel oracles.
