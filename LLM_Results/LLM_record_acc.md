# GPT4o Response

Based on a careful examination of the provided code, here are some possible bugs that could lead to the under-performance of the MPC controller:

- **Line number: 145**
  - **Code:** `std::vector<double> den(3, 0.0);`
  - **Explanation:** The initialization of the denominator coefficients for the low-pass filter might be incorrect. Proper filter design typically requires non-zero initialization to avoid issues in filtering operations.

- **Line number: 146**
  - **Code:** `std::vector<double> num(3, 0.0);`
  - **Explanation:** Similarly, the numerator coefficients for the low-pass filter might need specific values for proper filter operation.

- **Line number: 369**
  - **Code:** `const double v = injector_->vehicle_state()->linear_velocity();`
  - **Explanation:** Using the raw linear velocity without checking if it is within a valid range might lead to instability, especially if the velocity is very low or zero.

- **Line number: 442**
  - **Code:** `double acceleration_cmd = acc_feedback + debug->acceleration_reference();`
  - **Explanation:** The addition of `acc_feedback` and `debug->acceleration_reference()` without normalization or limits might cause sudden and large changes in the acceleration command, leading to instability.

- **Line number: 425**
  - **Code:** `const double steer_limit = std::atan(max_lat_acc_ * wheelbase_ / (vehicle_state->linear_velocity() * vehicle_state->linear_velocity())) * steer_ratio_ * 180 / M_PI / steer_single_direction_max_degree_ * 100;`
  - **Explanation:** This calculation of `steer_limit` assumes a non-zero velocity. If the velocity is zero or very low, it could lead to a division by zero or very high steering limits.

- **Line number: 565**
  - **Code:** `matrix_c_(1, 0) = (lr_ * cr_ - lf_ * cf_) / mass_ / v - v;`
  - **Explanation:** The division by `v` (velocity) might lead to issues if `v` is very low or zero. This can cause the matrix to have extremely large or undefined values.

- **Line number: 558**
  - **Code:** `matrix_a_(3, 3) = matrix_a_coeff_(3, 3) / v;`
  - **Explanation:** Similar to the previous point, this division by `v` can cause issues if `v` is near zero, leading to instability in the state-space model.

- **Line number: 385**
  - **Code:** `control[0](1, 0) = control_cmd.at(1);`
  - **Explanation:** The assignment of `control_cmd.at(1)` to `control[0](1, 0)` without validation might result in unexpected behavior if the control command is out of expected range.

- **Line number: 378**
  - **Code:**
    ```cpp
    if (!mpc_osqp.Solve(&control_cmd)) {
      AERROR << "MPC OSQP solver failed";
    }
    ```
  - **Explanation:** The code does not handle the case where the MPC OSQP solver fails, which might leave `control_cmd` in an undefined state, leading to erratic control commands.

These points highlight potential areas in the code that might lead to the under-performance of the MPC controller. Proper handling of these issues, such as adding checks for zero velocity, validating filter coefficients, and ensuring control commands are within expected ranges, could improve the controller's performance.

The provided MPC controller code is tested with the Carla simulator. Unfortunately, I found that the controller performs poorly and cannot follow the planned trajectory. It is possible that the provided contains several bugs that lead to such under-performance.

Now I need you to give me some suggestions on debugging these code. Based on your observation, and the result of your previous code analysis, please carefully examine the provided code, and tell me which part of the code could be buggy which I need to pay extra attention to.






# GPT4o Response



Based on the previous analysis and a careful examination of the provided code, here are some specific parts of the code that could be buggy and require extra attention:



- **Low-Pass Filter Initialization**
  - **Lines 144-148:**
    ```cpp
    std::vector<double> den(3, 0.0);
    std::vector<double> num(3, 0.0);
    common::LpfCoefficients(
        ts_, control_conf->mpc_controller_conf().cutoff_freq(), &den, &num);
    digital_filter_.set_coefficients(den, num);
    ```

- **Velocity Handling**
  - **Lines 370 and 554:**
    ```cpp
    const double v = injector_->vehicle_state()->linear_velocity();
    ...
    const double v = std::max(injector_->vehicle_state()->linear_velocity(),
                            minimum_speed_protection_);
    ```

- **Matrix Update**
  - **Lines 552-567:**
    ```cpp
    const double v = std::max(injector_->vehicle_state()->linear_velocity(),
                            minimum_speed_protection_);
    ...
    matrix_a_(1, 1) = matrix_a_coeff_(1, 1) / v;
    matrix_a_(1, 3) = matrix_a_coeff_(1, 3) / v;
    matrix_a_(3, 1) = matrix_a_coeff_(3, 1) / v;
    matrix_a_(3, 3) = matrix_a_coeff_(3, 3) / v;
    ...
    matrix_c_(1, 0) = (lr_ * cr_ - lf_ * cf_) / mass_ / v - v;
    ```
  - **Attention Point:** Carefully handle divisions by `v`. Adding checks to avoid very low values of v could prevent instability.




- **Control Command Calculation**
  - **Lines 474-482:**
    ```cpp
    double throttle_cmd = 0.0;
    double brake_cmd = 0.0;
    ...
    if (calibration_value >= 0) {
    throttle_cmd = std::max(calibration_value, throttle_lowerbound_);
    brake_cmd = 0.0;
    } else {
    throttle_cmd = 0.0;
    brake_cmd = std::max(-calibration_value, brake_lowerbound_);
    }
    ```
  - **Attention Point:** Validate `calibration_value` and ensure that the commands `throttle_cmd` and `brake_cmd` are within expected ranges.



- **Feedforward and Feedback Combination**
  - **Lines 442-446:**
    ```cpp
    double acceleration_cmd = acc_feedback + debug->acceleration_reference();
    ```
  - **Attention Point:** Ensure that combining `acc_feedback` and `debug->acceleration_reference()` does not result in sudden changes in `acceleration_cmd`.



- **Steering Limit Calculation**
  - **Lines 425-429:**
    ```cpp
    const double steer_limit = std::atan(max_lat_acc_ * wheelbase_ /
                                        (vehicle_state->linear_velocity() *
                                        vehicle_state->linear_velocity())) *
                            steer_ratio_ * 180 / M_PI /
                            steer_single_direction_max_degree_ * 100;
    ```
  - **Attention Point:** Check for divisions by `linear_velocity()` to avoid extremely high values if the velocity is low or zero.



- **MPC Solver Handling**
  - **Lines 378-384:**
    ```cpp
    if (!mpc_osqp.Solve(&control_cmd)) {
    AERROR << "MPC OSQP solver failed";
    } else {
    ADEBUG << "MPC OSQP problem solved! ";
    control[0](0, 0) = control_cmd.at(0);
    control[0](1, 0) = control_cmd.at(1);
    }
    ```
  - **Attention Point:** Ensure proper handling of the solver failure case. Add safeguards if the solver does not return valid control commands.



### Suggestions for Debugging:

- **Add Logging and Debug Statements**: 
  Enhance the logging to provide more insights into the values of critical variables (e.g., velocity, acceleration_cmd, matrix values).

- **Boundary Checks**: 
  Implement checks to ensure variables like velocity do not fall below certain thresholds to avoid divisions by zero.

- **Parameter Tuning**: 
  Verify and tune the parameters loaded from control_conf to ensure they are within reasonable ranges.

- **Solver Validation**: 
  Validate the outputs of the MPC OSQP solver before using them to update control commands.

- **Simulation Validation**: 
  Compare the calculated control commands (throttle_cmd, brake_cmd, steer_angle) against expected values during simulation to identify discrepancies.


By focusing on these areas, you can identify and resolve potential bugs leading to the poor performance of the MPC controller in the Carla simulator.





# User - S2. Interactive Querying - Cross-Module Insights


The provided MPC controller code is tested with the Carla simulator. Unfortunately, I found that the controller performs poorly and cannot follow the planned trajectory. It is possible that the provided contains several bugs that lead to such under-performance. The autonomous driving system is complex and consists of many different modules (e.g., localization, perception, planning, controlâ€¦). As a result, it is possible that such under-performance is due to the insufficiency of other modules.

Based on your observation, and the result of your previous code analysis, please carefully examine the provided code, and give me suggestions on what other modules that could affect the control performance, which I need to pay extra attention to.




# GPT4o Response



Given the complexity of an autonomous driving system and the interdependence of its various modules, several other modules could potentially impact the performance of the MPC controller. Here are some key modules to examine, along with specific aspects to focus on:

1. **Localization Module**
   - **Accuracy of Position and Orientation**: Ensure that the vehicle's position and orientation are accurately estimated. Errors in localization can lead to incorrect state estimation and control actions.
   - **Update Rate**: Check the frequency at which localization updates are provided. Delays or low update rates can negatively affect the controller's ability to react to changes in the environment.

2. **Perception Module**
   - **Obstacle Detection and Tracking**: Verify that the perception system correctly detects and tracks obstacles. Inaccurate obstacle information can lead to incorrect planning and, consequently, poor control performance.
   - **Environmental Mapping**: Ensure that the perception module accurately maps the environment and provides reliable information about road boundaries, lane markings, and other relevant features.

3. **Planning Module**
   - **Trajectory Generation**: Examine the quality of the planned trajectories. Ensure that the trajectories are smooth, feasible, and take into account the vehicle's dynamics and constraints.
   - **Dynamic Replanning**: Check if the planning module can handle dynamic changes in the environment (e.g., moving obstacles) and replan trajectories accordingly.
   - **Trajectory Consistency**: Ensure that the planned trajectories are consistent and do not introduce sudden changes that the controller cannot handle.

4. **Vehicle State Provider**
   - **State Accuracy**: Verify that the VehicleStateProvider accurately provides the current state of the vehicle, including velocity, acceleration, and heading.
   - **Latency**: Ensure that there is minimal latency in the state information provided to the controller.

5. **Communication and Synchronization**
   - **Message Latency**: Check for any communication delays between different modules. Latency in message passing can lead to outdated information being used for control decisions.
   - **Synchronization**: Ensure that the different modules are well-synchronized and operate with a common time reference to avoid inconsistencies.

6. **Configuration Parameters**
   - **Parameter Consistency**: Ensure that configuration parameters are consistently set across all modules. Mismatched parameters can lead to suboptimal performance or even instability.
   - **Parameter Tuning**: Review and tune critical parameters (e.g., control gains, thresholds) to ensure they are appropriate for the current vehicle and environment setup.

### Specific Aspects to Check in the Provided Code

- **TrajectoryAnalyzer**:
  - **Line 290**: `trajectory_analyzer_ = std::move(TrajectoryAnalyzer(planning_published_trajectory));`
    - Ensure that the TrajectoryAnalyzer correctly interprets the planned trajectory and provides accurate reference points.
- **Vehicle State Update**:
  - **Line 304**: `auto vehicle_state = injector_->vehicle_state();`
    - Verify that the vehicle state information (velocity, position, heading) is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Error Computation**:
  - **Line 535-549**: `ComputeLateralErrors` and `ComputeLongitudinalErrors`
    - Ensure that lateral and longitudinal errors are computed correctly based on the current state and planned trajectory.

### Recommendations for Debugging

- **Log Detailed Information**: Add logging in the localization, perception, planning, and state provider modules to capture detailed information about the state estimates, planned trajectories, and perceived environment.
- **Cross-Module Consistency Checks**: Implement checks to ensure that information provided by different modules is consistent. For example, compare the vehicle's position and heading as reported by localization and state provider modules.
- **Simulation Scenarios**: Run simulations with controlled scenarios to isolate and identify issues. For instance, test with static obstacles, varying speeds, and different road conditions to see how the system performs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Define and monitor key performance metrics such as trajectory tracking error, response time, and control command smoothness to identify areas of improvement.
- **Module Interaction Analysis**: Analyze the interactions between modules to ensure that data flow is efficient and accurate. Look for potential bottlenecks or points of failure.

By focusing on these modules and aspects, you can systematically identify and address issues that might be affecting the performance of the MPC controller in the autonomous driving system.
