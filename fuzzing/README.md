# Improved fuzzing

This is the improved fuzzing framework to create **critical scenarios** more effectively.

 - First, set up the fuzzing enviroment as guided in [Drivefuzz](https://gitlab.com/s3lab-code/public/drivefuzz/-/tree/master/).

 - Then, replace the py files under [src](https://gitlab.com/s3lab-code/public/drivefuzz/-/tree/master/src) with the files under the **src** folder here.

 - Finally, the improved fuzzing framework can by activated by running the updated _fuzzer.py_.

More guidance can be found in [Drivefuzz](https://gitlab.com/s3lab-code/public/drivefuzz).
